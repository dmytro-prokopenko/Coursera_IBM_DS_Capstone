# Coursera_IBM_DS_Capstone
Coursera IBM DS capstone project

This is a final Coursera IBM Data Science project

### Business Problem
Currently, it is not many places where one could buy a Gelato in Prague, but potential demand is high given the long queues.

### Instrumentation
In this capstone project, I will leverage the FourSquare API and K-means algorithm to find the best place to open a Gelato shop. To visualize the result of my work I will use Folium.

### Target Audience
Businessmen who are interested in high margin retail business in Prague
