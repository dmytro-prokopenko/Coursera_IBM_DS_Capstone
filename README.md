# Coursera_IBM_DS_Capstone
Coursera IBM DS capstone project

This is a final Coursera IBM Data Science project

### Business Problem
As a Gelato lover, I would like to open the ice-cream shop. Moreover, this is a high-margin business if done properly. With this work I would like to discover what neighbourhood in New York has a lesser number of such shops to open it there.

### Instrumentation
In this capstone project, I will leverage the FourSquare API and K-means algorithm to find the best place to open a Gelato shop. To visualize the result of my work I will use Folium module.

### Target Audience
Businessmen who are interested in high margin retail business in New York
